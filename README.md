## Google BOOKs API

This project is a React-based Google Books Search Engine that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and explore key details about each title. Users can enter a search term, view results in a responsive grid layout, and browse book information such as title, author, cover image, and description. The app is built with modern React patterns, asynchronous data fetching, and modular SCSS styling to ensure clean structure and maintainability.
